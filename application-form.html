<!-- Add to the HTML document application-form.html so that it has the following items.
    1.  A form that asks the user:
    •   Their first and last name (as separate fields),
    •   Their salary requirement as a number, and
    •   Which job they are applying for, from a list of:
    ◦   Software Engineer
    ◦   QA Engineer
    ◦   Product Manager
2. The form should also have a submit button that submits the form to the URL /application. This should be a POST request. (For now, JUST focus on the HTML requirements for this request. Don’t build a flask route, yet.)
    3.  The page should have a large heading and some explanatory text, as well.
